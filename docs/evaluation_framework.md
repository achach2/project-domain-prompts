Evaluation Framework for Comparing Prompting Techniques

1. Introduction

This framework is designed to systematically evaluate and compare different prompting techniques used in AI-generated validation reports. The primary goal is to assess their effectiveness based on key metrics such as relevancy, hallucination, comprehensiveness, and groundedness. This evaluation will involve both automated methods (LLM-based scoring) and expert human reviews.

2. Evaluation Metrics

We define four key metrics based on insights from arXiv papers and prior discussions:

Metric	Definition
Relevancy	Measures how well the generated text aligns with the given task, prompt, and input context. Inspired by (Sharma et al., 2017, arXiv:1708.02666).
Hallucination	Evaluates the extent to which an AI-generated response introduces false or unsupported information (Ji et al., 2023, arXiv:2304.08085).
Comprehensiveness	Assesses whether the response covers all necessary aspects of the task in sufficient depth, adapted from (Gabriel et al., 2021, arXiv:2104.08786).
Groundedness	Measures how well the generated response stays anchored to provided reference data (Li et al., 2022, arXiv:2203.08436).

3. Prompting Techniques Under Evaluation

The following prompting methods will be tested and compared:

Prompting Technique	Description
Chain of Thought (CoT)	Encourages step-by-step reasoning to improve accuracy and problem-solving (Wei et al., 2022, arXiv:2201.11903).
Tree of Thought (ToT)	Expands CoT by structuring reasoning hierarchically for complex tasks (Yao et al., 2023, arXiv:2305.10601).
Self-Consistency	Samples multiple responses and selects the most frequent or best-consensus answer (Wang et al., 2022, arXiv:2203.11171).
ReAct (Reason + Act)	Incorporates external knowledge retrieval (Yao et al., 2022, arXiv:2210.03629).
Role-Based Prompting	Assigns an explicit role to the LLM to influence response style and accuracy (Jiang et al., 2022, arXiv:2212.09741).
Contrastive Prompting	Compares AI-generated responses to identify optimal generations (Su et al., 2022, arXiv:2204.02311).
Augmented Contextual Prompting (ACP)	Dynamically retrieves external documents to enrich prompts (Lewis et al., 2020, arXiv:2005.11401).

4. Evaluation Methodology

The evaluation will be conducted in three phases:

Phase 1: Automated Metric Scoring

Each technique will be tested using three evaluation tools:
	1.	LlamaIndex (Evaluates relevancy and groundedness).
	2.	Ragas (Provides hallucination detection and quality scores).
	3.	Galileo (Analyzes comprehensiveness and response consistency).

Phase 2: Human Expert Review
	â€¢	Experts from RMG/MRM teams will review generated reports.
	â€¢	Blind comparative analysis: Experts evaluate responses without knowing which technique was used.
	â€¢	Feedback will be collected using a Likert scale (1-5) on each metric.

Phase 3: Comparative Benchmarking
	â€¢	Techniques will be ranked based on quantitative (metric scores) and qualitative (expert feedback) results.
	â€¢	Statistical analysis (e.g., ANOVA, t-tests) will assess significance.
	â€¢	Hybrid approaches (e.g., ReAct + Chain of Thought) will be explored if they show improved performance.

5. Data Sources & Test Cases

To ensure robustness, we will use:
	â€¢	Public model validation reports (to avoid internal data leakage).
	â€¢	Synthetic validation reports generated via ChatGPT/Llama 3.2 8B.
	â€¢	Historical validation documents (for context augmentation in ACP and ReAct).

6. Expected Outcomes
	1.	Identification of the most effective prompting technique for AI-assisted validation reports.
	2.	Quantitative benchmarks for comparing prompting approaches.
	3.	Insights into hybrid strategies for improving AI-generated content in regulatory and compliance tasks.
