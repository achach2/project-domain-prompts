### **Evaluation Framework for Comparing Prompting Techniques**

#### **1. Introduction**
This framework is designed to systematically evaluate and compare different **prompting techniques** used in AI-generated validation reports. The primary goal is to **assess their effectiveness** based on key metrics such as **relevancy, hallucination, comprehensiveness, and groundedness**. This evaluation will involve both **automated methods (LLM-based scoring) and expert human reviews**.

### **2. Evaluation Metrics**
We define four key metrics here:

| **Metric**         | **Definition** |
|--------------------|---------------|
| **Relevancy**      | Measures how well the generated text aligns with the given task, prompt, and input context. Inspired by (Sharma et al., 2017). Measures how well a generated response or retrieved context aligns with the user's query (LlamaIndex Relevancy). |
| **Hallucination**  | Evaluates the extent to which an AI-generated response introduces **false or unsupported information** (Ji et al., 2023). |
| **Comprehensiveness** | Assesses whether the response covers all necessary aspects of the task in sufficient depth, adapted from (Gabriel et al., 2021). |
| **Groundedness**   | Measures how well the generated response stays **anchored to provided reference data** (Li et al., 2022). |

### **3. Prompting Techniques Under Evaluation**
The following prompting methods will be tested and compared:

| **Prompting Technique** | **Description** |
|-------------------------|----------------|
| **Chain of Thought (CoT)** | Encourages step-by-step reasoning to improve accuracy and problem-solving (Wei et al., 2022). |
| **Tree of Thought (ToT)** | Expands CoT by structuring reasoning hierarchically for complex tasks (Yao et al., 2023). |
| **Self-Consistency** | Samples multiple responses and selects the most frequent or best-consensus answer (Wang et al., 2022). |
| **ReAct (Reason + Act)** | Incorporates external knowledge retrieval (Yao et al. 2022). |
| **Role-Based Prompting** | Assigns an explicit role to the LLM to influence response style and accuracy (Jiang et al., 2022). |
| **Contrastive Prompting** | Compares AI-generated responses to identify optimal generations (Su et al., 2022). |
| **Augmented Contextual Prompting (ACP)** | Dynamically retrieves external documents to enrich prompts (Lewis et al., 2020). |

### **4. Evaluation Methodology**
The evaluation will be conducted in three phases:

#### **Phase 1: Automated Metric Scoring**
Each technique will be tested using **three evaluation tools**:
1. **LlamaIndex** (Evaluates relevancy and groundedness).
2. **Ragas** (Provides hallucination detection and quality scores).
3. **Galileo** (Analyzes comprehensiveness and response consistency).

#### **Phase 2: Human Expert Review**
- Experts from **RMG/MRM teams** will review generated reports.
- **Blind comparative analysis**: Experts evaluate responses without knowing which technique was used.
- Feedback will be collected using a **Likert scale (1-5)** on each metric.

#### **Phase 3: Comparative Benchmarking**
- Techniques will be ranked based on **quantitative** (metric scores) and **qualitative** (expert feedback) results.
- Optional: Statistical analysis (e.g., **ANOVA, t-tests**) will assess significance.
- Hybrid approaches (e.g., **ReAct + Chain of Thought**) will be explored if they show improved performance.

---

### **5. Data Sources & Test Cases**
To ensure robustness, we will use:
- **Public model validation reports** (to avoid internal data leakage).
- **Synthetic validation reports** generated via **ChatGPT/Llama 3.2 8B**.
- **Historical validation documents** (for context augmentation in ACP and ReAct).

---

### **6. Expected Outcomes**
1. Identification of **the most effective prompting technique** for AI-assisted validation reports.
2. **Quantitative benchmarks** for comparing prompting approaches.
3. Insights into **hybrid strategies** for improving AI-generated content in regulatory and compliance tasks.
