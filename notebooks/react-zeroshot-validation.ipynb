Experimental Setup**  \n","- **Validation Instructions**: Use a predefined set of validation assessment guidelines, such as model framework evaluation, performance assessment, and risk analysis.  \n","- **Zero-Shot Prompting**: No prior training examples; the model will rely on the structured ReAct framework.  \n","- **ReAct Implementation**: Implement the **ReAct pattern in Python** using the snippet provided [here](https://til.simonwillison.net/llms/python-react-pattern).  \n","- **Evaluation Metrics**: Compare generated validation reports based on:  \n","  - **Relevancy** (Does it address the guideline?)  \n","  - **Hallucination** (Does it introduce false information?)  \n","  - **Comprehensiveness** (Does it cover all aspects of the assessment?)  \n","  - **Groundedness** (Does it use the provided context accurately?)  \n","- **Models Used**: Run the experiment using an LLM (e.g., GPT-4, Llama 3.2 8B).  \n","\n","---\n","\n","#### **2.
