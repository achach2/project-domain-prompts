To guide a large language model (LLM) like GPT to generate validation reports that follow human expert standards (in language, structure, or content), you can use one or more of the following prompt engineering and conditioning techniques:

⸻

1. Few-Shot Prompting with Human-Written Examples

Include 1–3 annotated examples of real human-written validation reports alongside their corresponding instructions and context. This teaches the model by demonstration.

Example Prompt:

You are a model validation expert.

Here is an example:
Instruction: "Assess whether model objectives align with core requirements."
Context: <...>
Expected Report:
- Objectives are stated in section 3.
- Requirements are in section 4.
- Alignment exists for objectives 1, 2, and 3, but requirement R4 is not supported.

Now, generate a similar report for the following:
Instruction: "Assess performance on test data relative to threshold."
Context: <...>

2. Custom Style and Structure Guidelines in System Prompt

Use a strong system prompt to enforce stylistic consistency and structure.

Example System Prompt:

You are a model validator writing regulatory reports. Your responses must:
- Use formal, concise language.
- Follow a structured format: Objective, Evidence, Conclusion.
- Reference section numbers or terms from the context.
- Avoid speculation or unsupported claims.



⸻

3. Template-Based Generation (with Slots)

Provide a fixed template where the model fills in sections. This is especially useful when the structure is non-negotiable.

Example Template in Prompt:

Validation Instruction: {instruction}
Context: {retrieved_context}

Please generate a validation report with the following format:
1. Summary of Instruction
2. Key Evidence from Context
3. Evaluation of Alignment or Compliance
4. Conclusion



⸻

4. Style Transfer Prompt

Guide the model to imitate the tone and structure of a given text.

Example:

Imitate the tone and formatting of the following expert-written paragraph:

"The MDD clearly outlines the performance targets, which are consistent with business objectives. However, the model fails to justify the use of reinforcement learning in context of limited training data."

Now write a similar validation report for this instruction: ...



⸻

5. Reflexion + Human Labeling Loop

Combine Reflexion with a comparison loop to the human-written report and prompt the model to improve.

Example Reflexion Loop Extension:

Human Written Report: <reference text>

Your Previous Report: <model output>

Task: Reflect on the differences. What elements are missing or phrased differently?
Then, revise your report to better match the style and completeness of the human version.

6. Fine-Tuning (Optional)

If you have a large set of real validation reports:
	•	Format them as {instruction, context} -> {expert-written report} pairs.
	•	Fine-tune a smaller LLM (like LLaMA or GPT-J) to internalize style and logic.

⸻

Recommendation

In your current setup using ReAct or Reflexion, the most efficient and practical solution is:
	•	Add a few-shot example with human reports before the final report prompt.
	•	Use a structured system prompt that enforces formatting and tone.
	•	Optionally include a sample human report as “style guidance” or feedback during the Reflexion loop.
