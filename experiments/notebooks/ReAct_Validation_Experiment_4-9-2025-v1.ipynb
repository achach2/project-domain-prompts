        "\n",
        "#### **Objective:**\n",
        "This experiment aims to evaluate the effectiveness of combining the **ReAct** (Reasoning + Acting) prompting technique with **Chain of Thought (CoT)** prompting to generate structured validation reports based on a given set of validation assessment instructions.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Experimental Steps:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Define the Validation Assessment Instructions:**\n",
        "   - Select a set of example validation guidelines (e.g., assessing the consistency of model assumptions, evaluating data integrity, verifying model performance).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Implement ReAct with Chain of Thought (CoT):**\n",
        "   - Use the **Python ReAct snippet** described in [Simon Willison’s post](https://til.simonwillison.net/llms/python-react-pattern).\n",
        "   - Modify the ReAct approach to include **step-by-step reasoning** before taking an action.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Prompt Structure:**\n",
        "   - Construct prompts that encourage the model to first **explain** its thought process before retrieving additional data or generating conclusions.\n",
        "   - Example prompt:\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "     You are an expert model validator. Your task is to analyze the following validation guideline step by step.\n",
        "     Step 1: Break down the key aspects of the requirement.\n",
        "     Step 2: Retrieve any necessary supporting evidence.\n",
        "     Step 3: Assess the evidence and form a logical conclusion.\n",
        "     Step 4: Generate a structured validation report.\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Run the Experiment with Different Models:**\n",
        "   - Test the approach using **Llama 3.2 8B** and **GPT-4** to compare results.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Evaluate Output Quality:**\n",
        "   - Use automated metrics such as **relevancy, hallucination, groundedness, and comprehensiveness** to assess the quality of the generated reports.\n",
        "   - Compare outputs with human expert reviews.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Compare with Standard ReAct:**\n",
        "   - Run the same validation process with **ReAct alone (without CoT)** and compare the quality of reports.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Refinement and Iteration:**\n",
        "   - Adjust the prompt structure to optimize the clarity, accuracy, and completeness of the generated validation reports.\n",
