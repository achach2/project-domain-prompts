    "- **Validation Instructions**: Use a predefined set of validation assessment guidelines, such as model framework evaluation, performance assessment, and risk analysis.\n",
    "- **Zero-Shot Prompting**: No prior training examples; the model will rely on the structured ReAct framework.\n",
    "- **ReAct Implementation**: Implement the ReAct pattern in Python using the snippet provided.\n",
    "- **Evaluation Metrics**:\n",
    "  - **Relevancy** (Does it address the guideline?)\n",
    "  - **Hallucination** (Does it introduce false information?)\n",
    "  - **Comprehensiveness** (Does it cover all aspects of the assessment?)\n",
    "  - **Groundedness** (Does it use the provided context accurately?)\n",
    "- **Models Used**: Run the experiment using an LLM (e.g., GPT-4, Llama 3.2 8B)."

    "## **2. Implementation Plan**\n",
    "### **Step 1: Prepare Input Data**\n",
    "- Define the **set of validation assessment instructions** (e.g., assessing model robustness, evaluating feature selection, checking compliance with regulatory guidelines).\n",
    "- Store instructions in a structured format (e.g., JSON).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 2: Implement ReAct for Validation Report Generation**\n",
    "- **Use the Python ReAct snippet from Simon Willisonâ€™s guide**.\n",
    "- Define a function that takes validation assessment instructions as input.\n",
    "- The function will use ReAct to:\n",
    "  1. **Retrieve relevant context** (e.g., model description, past validation reports).\n",
    "  2. **Generate step-by-step reasoning** on how to approach the validation task.\n",
    "  3. **Act** by synthesizing the final validation report.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 3: Run the Experiment with Zero-Shot Prompting**\n",
    "- Pass instructions to the LLM **without any example validation reports** (i.e., zero-shot).\n",
    "- Collect the generated outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 4: Evaluate Performance**\n",
    "- Compare **ReAct-generated** reports to **human-written validation reports** (if available).\n",
    "- Use **automated metrics** (e.g., LlamaIndex, RAGAS, Galileo) to assess performance.\n",
    "- Perform **manual evaluation** by SMEs (subject matter experts).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 5: Analyze and Iterate**\n",
    "- If reports show gaps (e.g., lack of depth in analysis), consider augmenting context retrieval in ReAct.\n",
    "- Test with **other prompting techniques** (e.g., Chain of Thought) for comparison."
