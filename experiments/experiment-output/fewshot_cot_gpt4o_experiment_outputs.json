The context lists two assumptions: feature independence and label accuracy.\n3. There is no mention of tests like correlation analysis or label reliability checks.\n4. Therefore, assumptions are clear but not validated with supporting analysis.\n\nFinal Assessment:\nThe MDD articulates its core assumptions well, including TF-IDF feature independence and the reliability of labeled data.
