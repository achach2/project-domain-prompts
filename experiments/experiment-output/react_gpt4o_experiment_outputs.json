The context explains that LightGBM was selected for its interpretability and performance. These are sound design requirements, especially in regulatory environments. The additional benefit of rapid retraining further supports operational feasibility.\n\nAction:\nThe selection of LightGBM is justified and aligns with the model\u2019s theoretical and design goals. The stated reasons meet key requirements for explainability, performance, and maintainability, indicating that the instruction is fully met.\n\nSelf-Criticism:\nUpon review, the response might benefit from mentioning a lack of comparison to alternative frameworks, which could add rigor. Still, the reasoning holds strong based on the provided context.",
