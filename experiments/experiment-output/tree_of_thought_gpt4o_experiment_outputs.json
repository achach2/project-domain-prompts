Assumes the label annotations are accurate representations of ground truth.\n\nStep-by-Step Reasoning:\n1. The instruction requires clarity and validation of assumptions.\n2. The context lists two assumptions: feature independence and label accuracy.\n3. There is no mention of tests like correlation analysis or label reliability checks.\n4. Therefore, assumptions are clear but not validated with supporting analysis.\n\nFinal Assessment:\nThe MDD articulates its core assumptions well, including TF-IDF feature independence and the reliability of labeled data. However, it lacks empirical validation to support these assumptions, such as correlation testing or label audit results.
