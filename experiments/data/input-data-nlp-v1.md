# Validation Assessment Instructions & Input Data for Testing the Customized ReAct Algorithm

Below, I provide three Validation Assessment Instructions and corresponding Input Data that align with the Data Requirements for ReAct-based Model Validation Assessment. This data will be used to test the Customized ReAct Algorithm for generating validation reports for an NLP model based on LightGBM that classifies bank customer complaints into two categories:

- EFA (Elder Financial Abuse)
- Non-EFA

## 1. Validation Assessment Instructions

These are three different validation assessment instructions that a validator may follow when assessing the model.

### Instruction 1: Assess Model Performance and Fairness

**Instruction**:  
Evaluate the LightGBM-based NLP model’s classification accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score in distinguishing between EFA and non-EFA complaints. Additionally, analyze whether the model exhibits any biases towards specific demographic groups (age, gender, socioeconomic factors) in its classification.

### Instruction 2: Assess Model Robustness to Data Perturbations

**Instruction**:  
Test the model’s robustness by introducing small perturbations in the wording, structure, and format of customer complaints. Compare the model’s predictions before and after these perturbations. Report any instability or inconsistencies in classifications.

### Instruction 3: Evaluate Model Interpretability and Explainability

**Instruction**:  
Analyze how the model determines whether a complaint falls under the EFA label. Use SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values or another explainability method to identify the most influential words or phrases leading to a classification. Compare model explanations with human expert judgments.

## 2. Input Data for Testing ReAct-based Validation Algorithm

To fully test the algorithm, we need structured input data following the Data Requirements document.

### A. Model Development Document (MDD) Excerpts

This is textual documentation describing the model, methodology, and assumptions used during development.

**Example MDD Content**:

The LightGBM-based classifier was trained on a dataset of 50,000 customer complaints labeled as either EFA (Elder Financial Abuse) or non-EFA. Feature engineering included TF-IDF vectorization of complaint text and additional metadata such as customer age and complaint length. The model was fine-tuned with Bayesian hyperparameter optimization. The final model achieved an F1-score of 85% on the test set. However, initial bias analysis suggests a potential misclassification rate disparity across different customer age groups.

### B. Sample Customer Complaints (Input for ReAct Context Retrieval)

These are real or synthetic customer complaints with their corresponding labels.

**Complaint 1 (EFA Example)**:  
“My elderly father, who has dementia, has been making multiple large withdrawals that he doesn’t remember. A bank employee ignored my request to freeze the account, and now there’s almost no money left. This seems like clear financial exploitation.”  
**Actual Label**: EFA

**Complaint 2 (Non-EFA Example)**:  
“I was charged an unexpected overdraft fee even though I had enough balance in my account. I contacted customer service, and they reversed the fee, but it took multiple calls.”  
**Actual Label**: Non-EFA

**Complaint 3 (Ambiguous Case)**:  
“My mother, who is 75 years old, had multiple checks bounce even though she claims she deposited money last week. She’s having trouble remembering details, and I suspect there’s a bank error, but I can’t get a clear answer.”  
**Actual Label**: ???

---

### C. Historical Validation Reports

These are previous validation reports related to similar NLP models used for financial complaint classification. This data helps the ReAct Algorithm retrieve relevant textual precedents.

**Example Historical Report**:  
“Previous models using TF-IDF and logistic regression showed higher recall but lower precision for the EFA classification. A review of misclassified complaints indicated that sentences mentioning ‘large transactions’ without explicit signs of elder exploitation were often wrongly classified as EFA. Ensuring model robustness requires refining keyword dependencies.”

### D. Expert Guidelines and Domain Knowledge

This consists of manual guidelines used by human experts to evaluate model outputs.

**Example Guidelines**:

1. **EFA Complaints Characteristics**:
   - Mentions of elderly individuals and financial exploitation (e.g., unauthorized withdrawals, coercion, fraud).
   - Complaints involving third-party interventions (family members, caretakers).
   - Indications of cognitive impairment affecting financial decision-making.
   
2. **Common Model Failure Cases**:
   - **False positives**: Complaints mentioning “elderly” but unrelated to exploitation.
   - **False negatives**: Complaints without explicit “elder” references but describing financial fraud.

## Next Steps

- Run the Customized ReAct Algorithm using the above input data.
- Evaluate model-generated validation reports using automated scoring metrics (relevancy, hallucination, comprehensiveness, groundedness).
- Compare outputs with human expert assessments to refine prompting techniques for model validation.
